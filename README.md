# Express Polar (Hunters)

### Background

This project ranked first place at the [Miami Univeristy Design Jam Spring 2023](https://dti.squarespace.com/designjam#:~:text=Express%20Polar "Miami Univeristy Design Jam Spring 2023").

In Express Polar, you race through a randomly-generated train, engaging in rhythm minigames and fleeing from the ever-growing threat posed by the train conductor.

### Systems

- This project does include EOS integration that allows the game to interact with online systems and the EOS overlay upon player login on the main screen.
- All assets were made by me (Frazier K. [BigNinjaChicken]) and randomly generated in the level to ensure a new game during each game session.
